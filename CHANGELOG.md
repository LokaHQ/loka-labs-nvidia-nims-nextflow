and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `rfd_openfold`: non-NIM RFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN/Rosetta followed by unpaired per-chain MSA generation, local OpenFold3 co-folding and BindCraft-derived scoring.
- `rfd_nim`: independent unpaired ColabFold alignments for binder and target chains and OpenFold3 NIM co-folding, with per-design structures, complete MSA/request/response provenance and separate binder/target pLDDT plus interaction PAE scores.
- Reproducible OpenFold3 response patch exposing the model's existing PAE matrix and original atom pLDDT, without changing weights or predictions.
- `examples/pdl1-rfd/run-aws-batch-nims.sh`: AWS Batch smoke test for the complete NIM workflow.
- `examples/pdl1-rfd/run-aws-batch-openfold-comparison.sh`: sequential one-design local versus NIM OpenFold3 comparison.
- BindCraft-derived PyRosetta and interface scoring for every OpenFold3 NIM prediction.

### Changed
- OpenFold3 reads binder A and cropped target B sequences from the threaded complex, validates their independently searched A3Ms and requires one diffusion sample per design. It folds from sequence without AF2 initial-guess coordinate seeding; matching score definitions does not make the models' confidence estimates interchangeable.
- The AWS NIM profile uses the canonical `rfdiffusion-nim` and `proteinmpnn-nim` ECR tags, which now point to the AWS Batch-compatible images with cleared entrypoints.
- CPU-only stages in the AWS Batch and AWS NIM profiles use the CPU queue instead of provisioning GPU instances.

### Fixed
- NIM workflow channels keep each backbone, designed sequence, structure and score associated throughout processing.
- AWS Batch OpenFold3 shared memory resolves to 16 GiB with both Nextflow 24.04.3's integer-MiB parser and supported stable unit-aware runtimes from 24.04.4 onward.
- BindCraft interface scoring no longer evaluates an unused ProteinMPNN parameter or warns when that parameter is absent.
- AWS Batch NIM tasks retrieve the NGC API key from Secrets Manager instead of persisting it in Nextflow work scripts.
- Pipeline parameter manifests are written through Nextflow's filesystem provider so S3 output paths receive `params.json`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- BindCraft: support for multiple input PDBs via directory or glob, with per-PDB trajectories and per-target reporting.
- Automatic datestamped Nextflow report/trace/timeline/dag under `${outdir}/logs/` (no DATESTAMP / `-with-report` / `-with-trace` needed in wrappers).

### Changed
- BindCraft batch directories and design names use `<pdbName>_<batchIndex>` (e.g. `batches/PDL1_0/`) instead of a bare integer batch index. BindCraft output CSVs include a `Target` column with the input structure filename.
- BindCraft helper scripts moved to `bin/bindcraft/` (`create_bindcraft_settings.py`, `bindcraft_scoring.py`, `add_bindcraft_target_column.py`).
- M3 platform configs (`m3`, `m3_bdi`): shared SLURM option variables at the top of each file (account, exclude, GPU/CPU presets); all jobs now pass `--exclude=m3t100`.
- BindCraft report headline accept rate collapses MPNN duplicates (unique trajectories with ≥1 accepted design ÷ total trajectories); rate including all accepted MPNN sequences is shown alongside.

### Fixed
- BindCraft report accept summary: trajectory outcomes (Relaxed / LowConfidence / Clashing) now sum to total trajectories; Accepted / Rejected MPNN designs are shown separately.
- BindCraft: process now fails (non-zero exit) when `bindcraft.py` crashes; previously `| tee bindcraft.log` masked the Python exit code so Nextflow marked the task COMPLETED.
- `bin/ipsae.py`: score RF3, native AF2 and Protenix predictions correctly. RF3 is now its own input format (scalar `iptm`, 0-indexed per-atom pLDDT) rather than an AF3 variant; list-wrapped AF2 `pae_model_*.json` and Protenix full-data JSON are accepted; and the structure format is detected from the real file extension, fixing `KeyError: 'id'` on rfd3/Boltz outputs whose `.pdb` filename embeds `.cif`.
- rfd3 modules pull `rc-foundry:0.2.0-weights` as an ordinary container image instead of `oras://`. The image was rebuilt as a multi-layer OCI image, so an `oras://` pull now fails with `ORAS SIF image should have a single layer, found 20`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- New `--method rfd3` workflow for RFDiffusion3-based binder design using `RosettaCommons/foundry` (RF3 batching, Boltz full-refold scoring, optional FoldSeek on refolded designs).
- Germinal antibody/nanobody design workflow (`--method germinal`).
- FoldSeek structural search (`--do_foldseek`) for the `rfd`, `bindcraft`, `boltzgen`, and `rfd3` workflows. Searches designed binder chains against structural databases (default: CATH50) to identify known folds and annotate results with CATH hierarchy descriptions. Supports local or remote search, gzip output, and optional HTML reports.
- Spartan HPC platform configs `spartan-a100.config` (gpu-a100-short) and `spartan-l40s.config` (gpu-l40s) for University of Melbourne Spartan.
- `conf/platforms/monash_containers.config`: container URL overrides so the `m3`, `m3_bdi` M3/MASSIVE platform configs pull mirrored containers from a Monash local server instead of `ghcr.io`. Some containers (`SILENT_FROM_PDBS`, `MMSEQS_COLABFOLDSEARCH`, FoldSeek) are not yet mirrored and still pull from their original registries.
- RFD workflow docs: table of built-in and bind-mounted HyperMPNN `--pmpnn_weights` checkpoints in the `proteinmpnn_dl_binder_design` container.
- Agent skill at `.agents/skills/nf-binder-design/` for AI-assisted pipeline setup and execution.
- `bin/complex_sasa.py`: per-residue delta SASA for target chains when a binder is removed from a complex, with optional site sums, batch PDB input, and `--min-change-percent` column pruning.
- nf-test `tests/pipeline/compilation.nf.test`: launches `rfd`, `rfd_partial`, and `rfd3` in `-preview` mode to verify every workflow/module compiles; run per Nextflow version with `NXF_VER=<version> nf-test ...` to guard against version-specific DSL parser regressions.

### Changed
- Docs: note Nextflow version compatibility. On Nextflow `26.04+` (new strict parser default), set `NXF_SYNTAX_PARSER=v1` to use the legacy parser.
- Trimmed README.md, testing section moved to `docs/docs/extra/development.md`, general docs cleanup and corrections.
- `manifest.nextflowVersion` now bounds the supported range to `!>=23.04.0, <26.10` (hard failure outside this range).
- Set `nextflow.enable.configProcessNamesValidation = false` to silence the "There's no process matching config selector" warnings printed on every run (only the selected `--method` workflow is included, so the `withName:` selectors for other methods' processes match nothing).

### Fixed
- `germinal`: `--method germinal` no longer crashes with a `MissingPropertyException` when `--germinal_pdb_dir` is omitted; the documented default (`../pdbs` relative to the config) is now inferred correctly (`config_path` is a `Path`, which has no `.parentFile`).
- `rfd3`: legacy `--pmpnn_temperature`, `--pmpnn_augment_eps` and `--pmpnn_omit_aas` flags are now honoured instead of being silently overridden by the modern `--mpnn_*` defaults. The modern name still takes precedence when both are set; defaults are unchanged (temperature `0.1`, structure noise `0`, omit `CX`, sequences-per-structure `1`).
- Nextflow 24.04.3 compatibility: the `rfd3` workflow and `boltz_refold_core` subworkflow no longer trigger the "Variable already defined in the process scope" DSL parser error on Nextflow 24.04.3 (a bug fixed in the 24.10 parser rewrite). Channel/path local variables use plain assignments instead of `def` in these workflow bodies.
- `foldseek`: database names containing `/` (e.g. `Alphafold/UniProt50`, `Alphafold/Swiss-Prot`) now download and search correctly; the download step creates the nested output prefix directory and the local search resolves prefixes nested one level deep.
- `examples/*/nextflow.dual-gpu.config`: fixed `if (params.gpu_devices) { maxForks = ... }` inside `withName:` blocks, which printed a `WARN: Unknown directive 'params'` on every dual-GPU example run and hard-errored (`Unknown config attribute`) if `--gpu_devices` was not passed. Replaced with a plain ternary assignment and a local `params { gpu_devices = '' }` redeclaration so the overlay file can resolve the param without depending on cross-file config evaluation order.
- `rfd`: configurable `RFDIFFUSION` via `rfd_command` and `rfd_model_directory_path` (Pawsey config overrides in `pawsey_setonix.config`; GPU behaviour uses existing `require_gpu` and `gpu_devices`).
- `rfd3`: `RFDIFFUSION3` and `ROSETTAFOLD3` now fail fast with a clear message when `nvidia-smi` is not installed (previously died with a cryptic `command not found` under `set -e`).
- `combine_scores.sh`: updated to the current `results/rfd/af2_initial_guess/{pdbs,scores}` output layout (was still pointing at the pre-reorg `results/af2_initial_guess/...`).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- New `nci_gadi.config` configuration profile for NCI Gadi HPC cluster.
- Initial [nf-test](https://www.nf-test.com/) test scaffold (`nf-test.config`, `tests/`) with a process test for `UNIQUE_ID` and `RFDIFFUSION`; documented in `docs/docs/testing.md`.
- BoltzGen: support for list-valued `entities[].file.path` and multiple entities so all referenced files are staged as Nextflow `path()` inputs. Referenced config YAMLs (`.yaml`/`.yml` in `entities[].file.path`, eg for nanobody scaffolds) and the PDB/CIF files they reference internally are collected and staged so BoltzGen’s per-generation random selection over those configs is preserved.
- Versioned documentation using [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike); docs are now deployed for `main` (alias: `latest`), `develop` (alias: `dev`), and version tags.

### Fixed
- Boltz refold RMSD and ipSAE: `BOLTZ_COMPARE_COMPLEX` and `BOLTZ_COMPARE_BINDER_MONOMER` now use Boltz complex chain **A** = binder and **B** = target (from `create_boltz_yaml.py` IDs), while the input design keeps `${binder_chain}` / `${target_chain}`. Previously the same chain letters were used on both structures, which mis-superposed RFD3-style complexes (target A, binder B) and inflated `rmsd_target_aligned_binder` / ruined aligned PDBs; `ipsae.py` now receives `--binder-chain A --target-chain B` for Boltz outputs.
- Boltz: `BOLTZ`, `BOLTZ_COMPARE_COMPLEX`, and `BOLTZ_COMPARE_BINDER_MONOMER` tee `boltz predict` to `.boltz_predict_console.log` and exit 1 if the log contains `ran out of memory, skipping batch` (Boltz may otherwise exit 0 and leave outputs missing).

### Changed
- `merge_scores.py`: drop from the right any column that exists in the current left before each merge so the result has no `_x`/`_y` suffixes; treat `.cif` as path-like (use basename for merge key) in addition to `.pdb`.
- `trim_to_contigs.py`: `parse_contigs()` now supports RFD3 v3 contig format (comma-separated, `/0` as separate element, e.g. `A18-132,/0,65-120`) in addition to v1 style.
- Major project restructure shifting individual workflows into `workflows/`, each launched via a single `main.nf` entry point with the `--method` flag.
  - `--method rfd` for RFdiffusion binder design (previously `main.nf`)
  - `--method rfd_partial` for partial diffusion (previously `partial.nf`)
  - `--method bindcraft` for BindCraft (previously `bindcraft.nf`)
  - `--method boltzgen` for BoltzGen (previously `boltzgen.nf`)
  - `--method boltz_pulldown` for Boltz Pulldown (previously `boltz_pulldown.nf`)
- Modules reorganised into `modules/local/` with workflow-specific subdirectories (`rfd/`, `bindcraft/`, `boltzgen/`, `common/`).
- Extracted common Boltz-2 refolding and scoring logic into `BOLTZ_REFOLD_SCORING` subworkflow (`subworkflows/local/boltz_refold_scoring.nf`).

### Fixed
- BindCraft (`workflows/bindcraft.nf`): omitting `--hotspot_res` no longer fails in `validateHotspotRes` with `Unknown method invocation 'trim' on Boolean type`.
- BindCraft (`workflows/bindcraft.nf`): allow explicit `--hotspot_res=""` to pass through as a no-hotspot BindCraft setting, and normalise empty hotspot list entries before writing settings.
- Declare `bindcraft_batch_size` default in `nextflow.config` so Nextflow does not warn when parsing `modules/local/bindcraft/bindcraft.nf` (unrelated to `-profile m3`).
- `rmsd4all.py`: cap worker processes to the number of pairs so single-pair comparisons (e.g. RFD3_RMSD with one design vs one refold) no longer spawn a large Pool and appear to hang; sequential path is used for one pair with progress logged.
- `rmsd4all.py`: add `--max-structural-iterations` (default 100). Biotite's refinement loop uses `max_iterations=inf` by default and only stops when anchors stabilize; with 3di the anchor set can fail to converge (oscillate) so the loop never exits. Capping iterations fixes the hang; 0 = no limit.
- `rmsd4all.py`: fix use of `array_length` (method) as if it were an attribute; use `len()` for atom counts.

### Removed
- `rmsd4all.py`: remove `--max-ca-for-tm-score` and `--pair-timeout` options.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-28

### Added

### Added
- BindCraft end-to-end workflow with basic HTML report
- GPU allocation heuristics for local multi-GPU workstations.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-07-11

### Added
- A plugin system for filtering designs based on calculated metrics.
- `--rfd_filters` parameter to apply filters to RFDiffusion backbones (e.g., `--rfd_filters "rg<25"`).
- Initial filter plugin for radius of gyration (`rg`).
- Integration of BindCraft-derived scoring of designs, as `extra_scores.tsv`. This adds metrics including:
  - Interface score, shape complementarity, dG, and dSASA.
  - Secondary structure percentages (helix, sheet, loop) for the binder and interface.
  - Unrelaxed and relaxed clash scores.
  - Hotspot and target RMSD.
  - Sequence-based metrics like extinction coefficient.
- `--pmpnn_omit_aas` flag to exclude certain amino acids from designs (default 'CX').
- `--rfd_compress_trajectories` flag to gzip RFDiffusion traj/*.pdb files (default `true`).

### Changed
- Filtering results are now saved to a subdirectory named after the pipeline step (in `filtering/rfdiffusion/`).
- The score merging script (`merge_scores.py`) was improved to be more robust and handle an arbitrary number of score files.
- Use more lightweight container for `get_contigs.nf` and `renumber_residues.nf` modules.

### Fixed
- The `gpu_device` parameter is now correctly passed to the partial diffusion process, allowing proper GPU selection.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-06-19

### Added
